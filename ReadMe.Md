## A Custom made python package for Binomial and Gaussian distributions

### This custom made python package provides the following functionalities
 - Reading a provided dataset of numbers
 - Calculates the Gaussian and Binomial distributions for numbers in the dataset
 - Plotting of Probability Density Function for both the Binomial and Gaussian distribution
 - The package requires [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) as a dependency.

### Installtion
``` pip install distributions ```


 The package was created as part of the course assignment for the [Machine Learning Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) course by Udacity.
